# Network Analysis of "Curb Your Enthusiasm"

This is a quick test to check what a network analysis can reveal about a TV series.
I only did the 9th season of the show, and the network graph looks like this:

I described the method and results on our research blog [**here**](http://weltliteratur.net/curb-your-enthusiasm-season-9-network-analysis/) (published on 1 Jan 2018).

The ```/s9/``` folder in this repo holds formalisations for all 10 episodes of season 9. I thought it would be good to also start formalising older seasons of the show, which for the time being resulted in an ```/s1/``` folder, which contains nothing more than the first ever episode. If time allows (which it probably won't) I might continue with this.
